## Introduction to MEVN

```
The MEVN stack is the open-source JavaScript software stack that has emerged as a new and evolving way to build powerful and dynamic web applications. Its software components can be used to effectively design frontend and backend development and improve the functionality of Veneu!

MongoDB - a document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store application data.
Express.js - A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of the site.
VueJS - Client-side framework used for front-end development.
Node.js - The javascript runtime environment.
With MEVN, javascript is used on all levels of development from client side to server side.
This simplifies the process and makes development faster and efficient.

### GraphQL

```
We use GraphQL to interact with the MongoDB database. The GraphQL client is used for tasks that are
repetitive and agnostic to the app we are building.

### Vue + Apollo

```
Apollo gives an abstraction layer and interface to the GraphQL server.
Vue is a progressive javascript framework for building the user interface.
 - at it's core, it provides a way to build components that encapsulate data/.js state and connect
   that state reactively to an HTML template.
