## Introduction to MEVN

```
MongoDB - a document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store application data.
Express.js - A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of the site.
VueJS - Client-side framework used for front-end development.
Node.js - The javascript runtime environment.

With MEVN, javascript is used on all levels of development from client side to server side.
This simplifies the process and makes development faster and efficient.

```

### GraphQL

```
We use GraphQL to interact with the MongoDB database. The GraphQL client is used for tasks that are
repetitive and agnostic to the app we are building.

### Vue + Apollo

```
Apollo gives an abstraction layer and interface to the GraphQL server.
Vue is a progressive javascript framework for building the user interface.
 - at it's core, it provides a way to build components that encapsulate data/.js state and connect
   that state reactively to an HTML template.
